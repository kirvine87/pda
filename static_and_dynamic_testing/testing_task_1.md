# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.
```ruby
#Class doesn't have a end
class CardGame
  #not right indentation 
  #Ace should not have a uppercase level
  #Should be underscores i.e check_for_ace
  def checkforAce(card)
    if card.value = 1
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end   
  #Function is not defined
  #As function is not defined class is using the end as it's on
  #There is an extra end
  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card
  else
    return card2
  end
end
end
  #Should not have a . in the function name
  #The total has not been set to equal anything therefore wont't do anything an is undefined so can't be used in return statement
  #This function is outside of the card class
  #mixing a string and integer
def self.cards_total(cards)
  total
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  end
end
